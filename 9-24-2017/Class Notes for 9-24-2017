For today's lesson we utilized bootstrap in order to duplicate the above the fold section of the forever21 website.

1) we created an global promotional area using the bootstrap full width container-fluid class

2) we brought in the default navbar (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#navbar-default) and changed all the inner text to reflect what forever21's site navigation has

3) we also added a brand image: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#navbar-brand-image

4) for the search box we took out the submit button and added "Button addons", including adding a magnifying glass icon into it

5) for the sign-in link we added a bootstrap modal component and then used the css from this example in order to make it slide from the right side of the screen

6) we added more glyphicons for heart and cart links

7) we added a currency/country selector using bootstrap dropdowns

Class Notes for 9/17/2017

we covered the "fixed to top" navbar feature in bootstrap and how to utilize it in our pages. we also covered bootstrap javascript components and plugins.

1) we started with our basic bootstrap html scaffolding that includes bootstrap css and js and jquery includes. 

2) we added a fixed to top navbar
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#navbar-fixed-top
	-we set the background-color to transparent and set the borders to zero so that the jumbotron image can show through

3) we added a fullwidth no-rounded corner jumbotron component
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#jumbotron

4) we used h1 and p tags to add content to the jumbotron section, we also added top padding of 150px

5) we used out container-fluid and container combination to get a full width section for the "why choose us?" section.

6) we used h3 and p tags to add the intro text for this section

7) we used an unordered "Inline" list
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#type-lists

8) we set each li element to use 4 columns 
'col-md-4'

9) we created 2 columns inside the li 
	-'col-md-3' for the glyphicon
	-'col-md-9' for the content


for the javascript portion 
1) we created a script tag at the bottom of the page after the last script include

2) we selected the 'window' object and added our own function to it's scroll method

3) inside the scroll method we selected the '.navbar' element and compared it's top offset to determine when the navbar has travelled more than 50px down the window.
	-we add a class of 'top-nav-collapse' to the '.navbar-fixed-top' element when the navbar is greater than 50px down the window and we remove the class when it's less than 50px

4) we add a new css class to style .top-nav-collapse to add background color and a css transition to smoothly fade in and out the background


Tracking the in-page navigation

we used the scrollspy bootstrap plugin in order to achieve this
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/javascript/#scrollspy 

this requires 3 steps

1) in the body tag add the following attributes: data-spy="scroll" data-target="#navbar-example"

2) add an id attribute to the global navbar element and set it's value to "navbar-example" in order to link up the scrollspy to the body tag

3) add in page anchors and reference those anchors in the navbar links

4) test out by scrolling the nav on the page

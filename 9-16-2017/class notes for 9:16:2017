class notes for 9/16/2017

we used our standard scaffolding which includes bootstrap css, bootstrap js and jquery from cdn

1) we utilized bootstrap navbar again
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#navbar
	a) remove all the uneeded links and search box in the html snippet

2) we utilized jumbotron again, the full width version without rounded corners
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#jumbotron

3) we dropped in our content, h1 tag, paragraph tag, button, image

4) we organized the content into a 2 column grid layout

5) we created a new folder called css/ and created a main.css file in there

6) we imported out css stylesheet into our page
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css">

7) we utilized google fonts for h1 and h2 tags
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fjalla+One 
and styled the h1 and h2 tags with the font-family css property:
	font-family: 'Fjalla One', sans-serif;

8) for all the main body content on the page we used the standard fluid-container with container combo, replacing 'my-custom-class-goes-here' with the class name we want for our new section
	<div class="container-fluid my-custom-class-goes-here">
      <div class="container">
      	content goes in here
      </div>
    </div> 

9) for the 4 column features section that has the glyphicons we utilized a 4 column grid layout and then we used the same method of setting the span inside this section to display:block in the css in order to get the icon and the text label into two rows.

10) we wrapped the glyphicons in a <div> tag and added a class of circle and used the following css to style the circle:

	border-radius: 53px;
    background-color: #1584be;
    width: 70px;
    height: 70px;
    padding-top: 14px;
    margin: 20px auto;


11) for the "Take A Closer Look" section, we used our container combo from step 8
and added h1 tag, p tag and button

12) for 'Business Theme Includes' section, we used the same container combo from step 8, and then h1 tag, unordered list (ul), an an image tag, we put everything into a 2 column grid and changed the background-color in css

13) for the 'More Features Include' section, we copied and pasted the 'Business Theme Includes' section and just changed the column ordering so that the image comes before the list content

14) for the footer we used out container combo from step 8 again added text-center to the inner container and placed out text inside


overall notes:
to hide content with bootstrap, we can use the hidden- class
to hide on mobile phones we can use hidden-xs
to hide on tablets we can use hidden-sm
to hide on regular desktop we can use hidden-md
to hide on larger desktop we can use hidden-lg

for the navbar:
to get the 2 line navigation links we did the following:

<li>
	<a href="#">HOME <span>Main Page</span></a>
</li>
we added a <span> tag inside the <a> tag and then in css we added a property to set the <span> inside of the navbar <a> tag to be display:block
example:
.navbar-default .navbar-right li a span {
	display:block;
}

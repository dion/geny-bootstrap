Class Notes for 9/10/2017

I created a github repository where all the class files will be stored.
https://github.com/dion/geny-bootstrap

Everything is organized by dates, so today's files are located under:
https://github.com/dion/geny-bootstrap/tree/master/9-10-2017

todays topics were on setting up bootstrap locally by downloading the source files and including them in our project and then organizing our folder structure so that everything is organized.

here's a screenshot of the page that we referenced in order to build out our page: https://github.com/dion/geny-bootstrap/blob/master/9-10-2017/mock.png

We utilized the following bootstrap components:
navbar inverted
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#navbar-inverted

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#jumbotron

we added a background image to the jumbotron with the following css:

we created a new external css stylesheet and included it into our page:
